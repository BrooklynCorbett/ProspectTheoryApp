        <h1>Interactive Prospect Theory Tool</h1>
        <p>This tool helps you explore the concept of <strong>Prospect Theory</strong>, which describes how people make decisions involving risk and uncertainty, especially when faced with potential gains and losses.</p>

        <h2>Explore Utility Function</h2>
        <p>The <strong>utility function</strong> helps us visualize how people react to gains and losses. The steeper curve on the loss side demonstrates <strong>loss aversion</strong>—the tendency for people to feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of gains. Adjust the sliders below to see how this changes.</p>

        <div id="graph"></div>

        <label for="alphaSlider">Alpha (Sensitivity):</label>
        <input type="range" id="alphaSlider" min="0" max="1" step="0.01" value="0.88">
        <span id="alphaValue">0.88</span>
        <p>Alpha controls the <strong>sensitivity</strong> to gains and losses. A lower alpha means people are more sensitive to changes in outcomes, while a higher alpha means they are less sensitive.</p>

        <label for="lambdaSlider">Lambda (Loss Aversion):</label>
        <input type="range" id="lambdaSlider" min="1" max="3" step="0.01" value="2">
        <span id="lambdaValue">2</span>
        <p>Lambda controls the degree of <strong>loss aversion</strong>. A higher lambda means people feel losses more strongly compared to gains.</p>

        <h2>Example: Choosing Between a Gamble and a Sure Loss</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're given two choices: (1) a 50% chance to lose £100 or (2) a guaranteed loss of £50. How do you make this decision? Prospect theory helps explain why many people might choose the gamble even though the expected value is the same. Adjust the sliders above to simulate this scenario and observe how your decision changes with different levels of loss aversion (lambda).</p>
